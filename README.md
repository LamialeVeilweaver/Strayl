## 简介 Intro
迴宿（huí xiù）是一种以弧线和星形符号为主要组件的密码，由莱米蕾进行主要开发。

截至目前，迴宿暂无独特的语法，并非一种语言或一种良好的加密系统，而只是一种**非常容易解开的加密表达方式**；它之于实际自然语言的关联可以被理解为「字体之于书面语言」。同时，由于目前的表达方式限制，迴宿表述信息所需的空间颇大，其观赏用处远超其作为真正加密方式使用的价值。

然而，也因为它仅仅是一种表达方式，故有较广泛的可能用法。在基础开发进行到一定程度，例如符号设计完毕、基本规则编写好，将会欢迎有兴趣者一同开发。

迴宿的电脑生成器仍未开始开发，但暂定的可能是会基于HTML5、JavaScript和CSS编写。

如果将来能够制作电脑生成的迴宿加密、甚至解密，并且对esolang有一定了解，将会考虑制作基于迴宿外观、但真正拥有形式语言特性的一种esolang；但这将会需要巨量时间与心力，请暂时先作为一个实现可能性较小的饼来看待。



Strayl is a cipher developed by Lamiale that mainly consists of arc segments and symbols resembling stars. 
With regard to its current state of development, Strayl, by itself, is not a language nor a reliable form of encryption. It does not contain a unique grammatical system (as in comparison with grammar in natural languages). It is currently an **easily-cracked encrypted way to express**, rather than an actual method of encryption that could secure the secrecy of messages. Its relationship with existing natural languages could be compared to that between *fonts* and *the written form(s) of legitimate languages*. Moreover, the current syntax of Strayl requires a relatively spacious area to convey meaningful contex. This furthers the purpose of Strayl as a mean of decoration. 

However, the vagueness of Strayl's current position could mean that there is a lot of room for development - subtypes could be differentiated from the original Strayl syntax, sets of modifications could be made... the possibilities are countless. Therefore, contributions are welcomed after initial developments (which includes symbol design and basic syntax construction). 

There is not yet a computer encrypter / decrypter for Strayl. One could be made in the future; it's likely this generator would be based on HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. 
If such program is written in the future, and that I have acquired a level of understanding of esolang that is enough for me to develop one, an esolang based on the appearance of Strayl may be developed. This version of Strayl would truly have properties of a formal language... or maybe not but you could code something out of it somehow. This, while not impossible, would take a huge amount of time and energy to make; so until then, please treat this as a mere possibility with a slim chance to happen.
